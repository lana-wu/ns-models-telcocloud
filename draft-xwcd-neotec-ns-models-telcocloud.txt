             draft-xwcd-neotec-ns-models-telcocloud-latest

Abstract

   This document describes how the various data models that are produced
   in the IETF can be combined in the context of Telco Cloud service
   delivery.

   Specifically, this document describes the communication of a Network
   Orchestrator and Cloud orchestrator for the realization of optimized
   Telco Cloud services to implement inter-dc reachability and
   connectivity services.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has produced several YANG data models that are instrumental
   for automating the provisioning and delivery of connectivity
   services.  An overview of these data models and a framework that
   describes how these various modules can be used together are
   described in [RFC8969].

   This document adopts the rationale of [RFC8969], but with a focus on
   the network coordination with Telco Cloud services.

   The document also identifies some gaps related to existing models.

   The document outlines an architecture and communication process of
   Network Orchestrators and Cloud orchestrators.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], and [RFC8309] as it uses terms from those
   RFCs.

   This document uses the term "network model" as defined in Section 2.1
   of [RFC8969].

3.  A Reference Architecture of Telco Cloud Network Coordination

   In some implementation, Cloud Orchestrator and Network Orchestrator
   are only associated with their own respective services.  That is,
   Cloud Orchestrator is responsible for data center (DC) services, such
   as application, compute, and/or storage services within the DC, while
   network Orchestrator plans and deploys connections based on planed
   inter-DC traffic demands.

   In certain scenarios, such as the [ETSI-GS-NFV-IFA-032] cross-site
   connectivity service interfaces definition, to support cloud-based
   cross-data center (DC) scaling, the NFV cloud platform can leverage
   network-exposed API interfaces to dynamically collect underlay WAN
   network status and establish/update inter-DC connections.  The
   architecture option is shown in the figure below.

   This NFV cloud architecture option implies that the Cloud
   Orchestrator operates with network-awareness.  The Network
   Orchestrator exposes the interfaces to provide pre-planned bandwidth
   and dynamic connections.  The Cloud Orchestrator can then dynamically
   control and manage the capacity and network connections between WANs
   of inter-DC.  As suggested in [ETSI-GR-NFV-SOL-017], The candidate
   IETF interfaces between Network Orchestrator and Cloud Orchestrator
   are outlined in the table below:

   However, this NFVO architecture option cannot meet the emerging needs
   of telecom cloud applications because it is difficult to plan
   bandwidth between large-scale edge DCs and enterprise sites.  For
   example, AI-based video analysis and AI-driven knowledge reasoning
   will be deployed in edge data centers, which are characterized by a
   large number of deployments and significant variations in resource
   capabilities.  Combined with the diversity of enterprise sites, the
   new telecom cloud needs fast, private, and reliable connections
   between site-to-site, site-to-cloud, or cloud-to-cloud endpoints.

   A potential alternative architecture option involves centralized
   scheduling of cloud and network resources to coordinate their
   integration, enabling rapid deployment of network services and
   applications such as SD-WAN, SASE, and other edge cloud services.
   This approach ensures agile allocation of cloud resources and
   optimization of WAN network resources to meet dynamic demand.

    Figure 2: Alternative Architecture of the Cloud Service Provisioning

   This proposed telco cloud reference architecture is an open framework
   to allow for multiple vendor Network Orchestrators and multiple
   vendor Cloud Orchestrators.  The goal is to enable standard data
   models or APIs to provide those services.

4.  Telco Cloud Service Requirements

4.1.  Optimized Scenarios of Telco Cloud Service Placement

4.1.1.  Example of Overlay Network and Cloud Service Placement

   The diagram below illustrates a telco cloud network example
   connecting multiple data centers (DCs) and enterprise CEs.  Multiple
   data centers are shown, each potentially hosting different services
   or applications.  For instance, DC-1 is directly linked to gateway
   GW2A and GW2B, suggesting it may host critical applications or
   services that require high availability.  Various DC gateways are
   deployed to manage traffic flow towards Data Centers or Application
   instances.  Two CE1 devices are connected to PE5A and PE5B
   respectively, indicating the start points for customer traffic
   entering the provider's network.  There are several Provider Edge
   devices (PE5A, PE5B, etc.) which serve as entry and exit points for
   traffic moving between the customer and the provider's network.  The
   Border routers (BRs) facilitates the transfer of data across
   different parts of the network.  They connect the access/aggregation
   layer to the core network.

  Figure 3: Coordination of Network Resources for the Cloud Service
                             Provisioning

   To create services across DCs like optimized service placement,
   generic API calls are needed.  A typical usage is to use Restful APIs
   of Cloud Orchestrator and Network Orchestrator and used by the Super
   Orchestrator to provision the inter-DC services connections and also
   applications.

   When deploying cross-DC cloud services, it is assumed that the Super
   Orchestrator has access to the DC and network connectivity topology
   (e.g. TE Topology [RFC8975]), as well as centralized resource
   information for both the DCs and the network.  Some standard network
   inventory interfaces are available.  For example, the Service
   Attachment Points (SAPs) [RFC9408] or ACs
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit] can obtain the AC/Bearer
   information of the PE, which suggests that the private line service
   provisioning resource resources on the network side, but there is no
   cloud DC service provisioning resource information, such as CPU, GPU,
   storage, and DC network information.  DC aware TE topology model
   [I-D.llc-teas-dc-aware-topo-model-04] defines YANG models about the
   information.  One API example is as below.

                     Figure 5: Cloud Service Placement

   Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the flowchart with detailed
   explanations for each step:

   1.  Step 1: Requirement Analysis: This is the first step where the
       Super Orchestrator gathers and analyzes requirements for branch
       data transfer.  Key Requirements are bandwidth must be at least
       100 Mbps, data must be transmitted over a private connectionbe,
       and support AI analysis. the Super Orchestrator also determines
       the optimal allocation of resources for data transfer.  Data will
       flow from the branch office to the center data center (DC).  A
       edge DC is selected as an intermediate hop.  A dedicated line of
       100 Mbps of bandwidth with redundant links and to the center and
       edge DC is needed.  Underlay Network Controllers may expose to
       Network Orchestrator s a set of network data models, such as the
       AC, L3SM [RFC8299], L3NM [RFC9182], L2SM [RFC8466], L2NM
       [RFC9291], RFC9543 NSS YANG Model
       [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang], Service Attachment
       Points (SAPs) [RFC9408], TE Service Mapping
       [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang], TE Tunnel
       [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te], or SR Policy
       [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-policy-yang].  Network Orchestrator can use
       these models to set up connections between the Provider Edge
       devices, and also customer facing ACs between CEs and PEs, DC-GWs
       and PEs.

   2.  Step 2: Application Instances Deployment and Parallel Network
       Connectivity: This step involves deploying AI at the center DC
       and the edge DC.  With request from Super Orchestrator, Cloud
       Orchestrator allocates resources, including GPU clusters and
       storage.  Also Network Orchestrator can configure PE.

   3.  Step 3: Validation and Monitoring: This step ensures that the
       service meets performance and reliability expectations.  Through
       the open interfaces, Super orchestrator can monitor status of
       cloud resources and WAN connections.  The open interfaces could
       be VPN PM [RFC9375] ,Alarm Management [RFC8632], or new service
       assurance models.

   The steps described above assume that Super Orchestrator can access
   both network and cloud resources to perform resource analysis and
   allocation.
